1. The general trend in the curve is an increase in accuracy with an increase in the portion of the training set used for training.
2. The noisiest part of the graph appears to be those between 45-65% of the data used for training.
3. At about 3000 trials, the cure appears approximately smooth.
4.
at C = 100**-10:
Short spike up up to 15% data used, then immediate downspike to about 10% accuracy for the entire thing.
at c = 10**-100:
Little variation around 0.0990; as the percent of data used for training increases variation increases 
at c = 10**-1:
It starts at 88% accurate and quickly maxes out at just shy of 100%.
